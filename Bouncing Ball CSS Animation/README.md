In this, we create a simple bouncing ball animation:

The HTML file contains a div element with the class "ball," which represents the bouncing ball.

The CSS file styles the ball with a blue color, sets its size and shape to create a ball, and defines a keyframe animation called "bounce."

The "bounce" animation moves the ball up and down by changing its transform: translateY property. The ball changes color to red at the peak of its bounce to make it more visually appealing.

To see the animation in action, create the HTML and CSS files, save them in the same directory, and open the HTML file in your web browser. You'll see a bouncing ball that changes color at the peak of each bounce.
